# Food App Flutter (project_demo)

A Flutter-based re-creation of selected features from my previous Java/XML-based food planner app, built to deepen my understanding and practical experience with Flutter.

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a learning-focused reimplementation of core features from my earlier Android project built with Java and XML. It is **not a full replica**, but rather a Flutter-powered exploration of key app functionalities to strengthen my mobile development skills using the modern Flutter framework.

### ✅ Features Implemented:
- **User Authentication** (Email/Password)
- **Category List Display**
- **Meal List by Category**
- **Add to Cart**
- **Delete from Cart**
- **Local Database Integration** using `sqflite`
- **Network Calls** using `Dio` for API integration
- **State Management** using `Cubit` and `BLoC` (via `flutter_bloc` package)

## 🧠 State Management

To manage UI state and logic cleanly, the project uses the **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** pattern with **Cubit** from the `flutter_bloc` package. This helps in separating business logic from the UI, making the app more scalable and testable.

## 🚀 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to practice Flutter development and get hands-on experience with:
- Building UI using Flutter widgets
- State management with Cubit/BLoC
- Local storage using SQLite
- Working with APIs using Dio
- Basic app structure and best practices in Flutter
